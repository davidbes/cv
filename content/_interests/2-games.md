Beside sports I love video games too. I was sitting behind my brother's computer almost all the time untill I got the money to buy my own. It wasn't a good computer but it did run some decent games at the time. <br>
I started loving games even more and then I found out about a game called League of Legends. I am playing this game mainly for about 5-6 years now. I have 3500 hours on record. But beside this game I did try mutliple other games such as: Overwatch, World of Warcraft, 7 Days to Die, H1Z1 and more. 
But my all time favorites are of course League of Legends and Warframe.
