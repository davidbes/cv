I have been practicing sports ever since I was 5 years old. I was into swimming until I was around 10, then I joined athletics and quit after a year. After that I got my interst into Judo. I trained Judo for 5 years and got a green belt. But because of knee problems I had to leave. After that I gained some weight since I was not training anything and then decided to do fitness. I am currently into fitness for the 4th year in a row. I mainly focus on power lifting but I am into bodybuild too.
