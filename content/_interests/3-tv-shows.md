hobby: TV Shows and Movies
---
 
I am a huge fan of movies and TV series. I watched most of the movies that came out for the past 2 years. I even collect movie tickets.
I got around 35 of them at the moment considering I do not save the tickets for the movies that I have already watched.<br> As for the TV series I
watch series with a deep story like: Game of Thrones, American Gods, Peaky Blinders, Vikings etc. I watched over 14 TV Shows, some of them multiple times.
My all time favorite are probably Peaky Blinders, GoT and Black Sails.
