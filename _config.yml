# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: Your awesome title
email: your-email@example.com

  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this

  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "cv" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog

  I am a 17 year old Student coming from Kranj, Slovenia. I was born in Kranj and am living there ever since. I started digging into programming because I
  had an internship at the firm called 3fs. This intersts me because I have been into computers and games ever since I was 5 years old. My dream in life is
  to create an MMORPG game that has been on my mind for 3 years now. I also love sports, movies, comicbook characters and dogs. I also have a cat x_x
